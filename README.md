This is a three.js - webgl - Ocean example converted to a typescript project. The 3d models are from [Sketchfab]( https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/gumshoe-male-db3920b942594294a3b4643a0ee1ec0e) and Threejs.org. 

## üëá Prerequisites

You'll need to have the following prerequisites installed:

Node.js: ReactJS requires Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, to run on your machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

npm (Node Package Manager): npm is installed automatically along with Node.js. It is used to install and manage dependencies for your ReactJS projects.

Once you have Node.js installed, open your command prompt or terminal and verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly by running the following commands:

```
node -v
npm -v
```
then run the following commands in the command prompt or PowerShell to get started. 
```
git clone https://github.com/Sean-Bradley/Three.js-TypeScript-Boilerplate.git
cd Three.js-TypeScript-Boilerplate
npm install
npm run dev
```
